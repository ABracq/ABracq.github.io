        <h2 class="h2num3">Education</h2>
        <p class="pnum6">I Started my education in interactive media design at high school. During the 11th-12th grade, I had courses that revolved around programming, 3D design, audacity, After effects and Photoshop. I liked those classes a lot mainly because they peaked my interest in design for things like video games, animation, design and video editing. <br><br> The teacher taught me a lot of things like brackets (another version of Visual Studio Code), Javascript, and Android Studio for programming. What I remember the most about this course is Blender, where I first stepped into the world of 3D modeling and animation. I suppose my passion and interest in the program is what lead me to have the highest grades of all my class. I also got some knowledge in Photoshop and After effects, with similar grades. <br><br> As of now, I am in College. I am learning several ways to build a website (HTML, Shopify, Wordpress), Adobe programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere pro, and XD) and basic design principles and plans. My plan is to decide which IMD part captures me the most so I can capture myself a specialty. Then, that specialty is what will lead me to my career in the media industry. Hopefully, I find something I love doing for hours on end.</p>

        <p class="pnum6">For the most part, I made a lot of progress in the design and programming world. I designed a website for a Bakery named "The Shealery". The owner, Mike Sheal, was very satisfied with the result. <br><br> I made several Youtube videos with the help of Premiere pro. In it, I displayed my video editing skills and other things like my supreme videography and audio skills. Thanks to it, I am able to film tutorials, vlogs and interviews with great quality. To be honest, these were the most amusing projects to do so far. The power you get with editing programs and the big reward you get afterwards is unrivaled with other classes. <br><br> I also designed several things in Illustrator which you can find in my <a class="anum2" href="fifthpage.html">Drawings</a>I have talent in more than in electronics. I have proficiency in French. I served the Canadian Navy for about a year. I have around 10 years of hockey experience.</p>
