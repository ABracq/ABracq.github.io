            Dear Mr. Day<br><br>
                
            I am applying for the position of 2D digital artist as my full-time job in Keywords Studios. My education and work experience qualify me for this position.<br><br>
                
            As of now, I am a College student at Algonquin College. I am currently learning the program of  interactive media design. In this program, I have learned Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Visual Studio Code. Meaning that I am experienced in design and photographic programs for computers. Also, I have participated in week-long programs at La cité Collégiale in 3D design and graphic design. This gives me an edge with using Blender and Maya, which are 3D programs used for modeling and animating things like vehicules, characters, buildings, etc.<br><br> 
                
            For work experience, I am more than qualified for the position. I was a naval reservist for the Canadian navy for 5 years. I worked as an intelligence operator where I handled government documents related to politics, military equipment and global news. This makes me great with handling classified and important documents as well as researching for them. I also worked at Party City for about a month where I handled Halloween costumes for kids and adults alike.<br><br> 
                
            I am available on any day of the week for an interview. Thank you for taking your time to read my cover letter.
