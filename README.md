Hi and welcome to my portfolio website.

In this assignment, I created a website describing who I am, what I do and what I made in the past regarding programming and illustration. Things that I both made during my free time and projects that I made while in the IMD course. 

I made the website using the web portfolio design that I made using Adobe XD while in the Use experience design class. I simply copied to my best of abilities the whole website. The plan was to make the css as accessible and functionnable as possible. Therefore, it took me until three days later until I made the other webpages. I simply wanted the footer, the nav and the header to be done properly so I will not have to deal with these things later. 

Taking the photos was easy. I already had the photos in the portfolio design. All I had to do was to grab them and make it compatible for programming. Because of this, no outside stock footage was needed. The real issue was to align them properly on the grid and with other photos in the fifth page where my drawings are. 

Because the design of the portfolio in XD included the color palette and fonts, I did not had to waste time adding colors into the website. Unfortunately, no Futura/Bahnschrift font was available on any font website I looked. None of them worked properly and those who did work had to be payed. I refused to pay 30$ just for some fancy text style. In the end, I decided to replace them with Nunito and Barlow. They still fit in my website look.

No outside framework, Plugin, image or library was used in this project.
